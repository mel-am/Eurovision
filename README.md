About Our Project:
The purpose of this website is to display and play all of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 entry videos, with a comment box to share your thoughts!


User Stories:
-As a user, I want to be able to view all of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 videos on a web page.

-As a user, I want to be able to leave a comment after the videos at the bottom of the page.

-As a user, I want the website to be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.


Features (MVP)
The website displays all 37 entry videos for the 2024 contest. They are embedded so you that you can click ‘play’ and watch them without visiting an external site.

There is a fully functioning comment box - try it out and share your thoughts with us!

The website is accessible and can be used on mobile and desktop devices. Lighthouse scores: Performance: 99
Accessibility: 88
Best Practices: 78
SEO: 91


Features (Stretch)
We included a ‘Meet The Devs’ page which is linked via the nav bar.

We included a ‘like’ & ‘dislike’ function within the comment box (Thank You For The Music, I mean… encouragement, Abba).

We built a drop down box which allows you to choose your favourite Eurovision 2024 entry!

We added an animation too!


Trello
We assigned actions and planned out the process and requirements for our project using Trello. We also used this to share quick links to shared resources.


Wireframe
We planned how our website would look using FigJam / Figma to create a wireframe. We referenced & amended this throughout the development (agile, mate).


Collaboration & Principles
We first spent some time getting to know each other - our likes & dislikes - shared interests - general team building chit chat!

We then encouraged an honest conversation about our strengths and weaknesses that relate to the project & set a realistic goal of what we felt we could all achieve, whilst also trying to push ourselves.

From this discussion, we agreed to play to our strengths and support each other, and continued to encourage honesty if anyone felt lost or unhappy with the direction at any stage.

We agreed on the Eurovision theme and created the Trello board, Github Framework, User Stories & Wireframe as a basis for the project.

We decided that due to our current skill levels, that working collaboratively using Live Share in VScode was the most effective way to tackle the project and provided a great opportunity for us to learn from each other and grow together.

We took regular breaks - wellbeing is important!

Every morning we recapped and took an agile approach, reviewing the Trello board, discussing progress and blockers, and planning the actions for the day ahead.

We worked jointly on almost all aspects of the build, utilising Live Share in VScode & occasionally working solo or in pairs, in branches.

We protected the ‘main’ branch and set up a review system to ensure that another member of the team could check the changes before merging into the ‘main’ from any other branch.


Reflections
We encountered a few challenges along the way & all now share a mutual love(hmm)-hate relationship with CSS & positioning! 

We overcame issues with muddled up data, embedding videos in JS, pulling and pushing data for drop down favourites box - but we got there! <3

We were all vibing when everything started to come together & made sure to celebrate our successes (and the friends we made) along the way!
